# 5_00_Mid-Bootcamp-Project
This project is about exploring the real estate market in the city of Zurich. The dataset was collected from different spots.


# 1. Motivation: 

For my Mid-bootcamp project at the Ironhack Bootcamp I decided to analyse the real estate market in Zurich. 
I am personally interested in the matter since I am planning to move there and I wanted to better understand how the renting and buying prices were
distributed around the city and if it does make more sense to buy or rent an apartment depending on different factors.

# 2. Features:
